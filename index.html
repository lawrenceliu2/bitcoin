<h1>What is Bitcoin?</h1>
<p>First decentralized digital currency
<ul><li>Operated by a multiple entities all around the world, known as miners</li>
<li>Not tangible, only exists online (ie. riot points, mesos, arcane dust)</li>
<li>No real value, driven by the people and the system</li></ul>

First implementation of a cryptocurrency
<ul><li>Digital currency that uses encryption to regulate creation/transaction instead of a central authority</li>
<li>First theorized in 1998, developed in 2009</li></ul>
</p>

<h1>How do you get Bitcoins?</h1>
<p>
<ul><li>Buying them with US Dollars, Euros, etc. through a bitcoin exchange</li>
<li>As payment for goods or services</li>
<li>Exchange them with someone near you</li>
<li>Through mining</li></ul>
</p>

<h1>What are the advantages of Bitcoin?</h1>
<p>
<ul><li>Can be transferred from person to person -> No need to go through a bank -> Fees are much lower</li>
<li>Less risky for merchants (protection from fraud)</li>
<li>Payment is as easy as sending a text</li>
<li>Security and control (no unwanted changes can be forced and no personal information used in transactions, backup and encryption available)</li>
<li>Transparent and neutral</li></ul>
</p>

<h1>What are the disadvantages of Bitcoin?</h1>
<ul><liLack of awareness and understanding (in both business and society)</li>
<li>Very volatile due to amount of Bitcoins in circulation</li>
<li>Still a developing project, many features are incomplete and new tools, features, and services are always in development</li>
<li>They are not widely accepted and their value fluctuates</li>
<li>Risk of technical flaws</li>
<li>Price of electricity is generally higher than value of bitcoins mined</li></ul>

<h1>The Bitcoin Blockchain</h1>
<p>
Each transaction in bitcoin is its own separate entity, containing the source of the sender’s bitcoins, recipient, amount, and signature, as well as a few other pieces of data.
Several transactions are collected into what is known as a block, and are attached to the current transaction history (the block chain) as a node, storing the hashed index of the block before it.
Because the blocks in the block chain are only capable of referencing one previous block, the order of the transactions is safeguarded.
The block chain is shared between all bitcoin users, and is not encrypted, which allows any user to view the currency’s entire transaction history if they really wanted to.
Transactions in a block are considered as having occurred at the same time.
Transactions not yet placed in a block are known as unconfirmed.
One of the most important roles of the blockchain is preventing double spending and other such fraud.
</p>


<h1>Bitcoin Mining</h1>
<p>
Mining is a process of both verifying transactions and distributing bitcoins.
In the process of mining, unconfirmed transactions are gathered into a block and then suggested to the network as one possible configuration.
The structure of a block is used for some complex mathematical calculations, and is verified if it passes these checks; more on this later.
Bitcoin miners try to input random numerical values in order to get the output of the calculations below a certain threshold.
The first person to be met with success broadcasts the block they formed to the rest of the network, and it is added to the chain.
A block is mined every ~10 minutes.
If two blocks are added to the chain at the same time, machines work with whatever they received first. At the next solution, all members of the network are standardized to the longest chain, keeping everyone on the same page.
When a block is solved, the user is given a reward in bitcoins (free money!), incentivizing the process.
The reward halves each year, so eventually it will hit 0 BTC (est. by 2140). In that case, miners will receive transaction fees for including those transactions in their blocks to continue incentive.
